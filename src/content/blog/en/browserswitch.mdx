I'd been using Brave for years, ever since it was released. I also tried Firefox without migrating my data from Brave, but I returned to Brave after a few days because I needed my browser history. I did a full data migration from Brave to Firefox to give it another try after Firefox version 116 added a volume slider to its built-in PiP (Picture-in-Picture) feature.

I've been using Firefox _Nightly_ for two months now. I'll tell you about my experience with the browser's nightly build. And we don't talk about crappy Chrome here, I uninstalled it from my computer.

## Why Firefox?

-  Better [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) support. ([Documentation](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-Origin-works-best-on-Firefox))
-  Built-in Picture-in-picture (PiP) support.
-  Built-in page screen capture feature.
-  [Firefox Relay](https://relay.firefox.com/) - A mail spoofing service.
-  Looking for a new experience.

## Data Migration

It wasn't easy switching from Brave to Firefox, it took me some time to research how to migrate my data.

### History Migrate

Firefox does not officially support history import from Brave (and I believe no other browser does). Through internet research, I was able to find a solution. Since Brave and the new Edge both use Chromium, I can manually copy Brave's history to Edge. I could then import my Edge history to Firefox because Firefox supports importing history from Edge. _Of course you can use Chrome to do the same._

<details>
   <summary class="text-xl font-bold hover:underline hover:cursor-pointer w-fit">Steps</summary>

      **Step 1: Copy Brave's history to Edge/Chrome.**
      - Open _Run_: <kbd class="kbd text-base-content">Windows ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd text-base-content">R</kbd>
      - Type: `%appdata%` then press OK
      ![Run window.](../assets/browserswitch/runwindow.webp)
      - A new File Explorer open, if you're in the _Roaming_ folder, click _AppData_ then go to _Local_ folder.
      ![Roaming](../assets/browserswitch/roaming.webp)
      - Open _BraveSoftware_ > _Brave_Browser_ (_Brave_Browser-Beta_ if you're using Beta) > _User Data_
      - Copy `History` and `History-journal` file
      ![History Files](../assets/browserswitch/historyfile.webp)
      - Now go back to _Local_ folder, go to _Edge_ (Chromium Edge) User Data folder: _Microsoft_ > _Edge_ > _User Data_ then paste the copied history files.

      **Step 2: Import Edge's history to Firefox.**
      - Open _Firefox_ > _Settings_ > _General_ > _Import Browser Data_ > _Import Data_ > Select _Microsoft Edge - Profile_, tick _Select All_ option > Import.

### Account & Passwords Migrate
Lastest version of Firefox supports importing passwords from .csv file which is pretty easy to migrate.
    
<details>
   <summary class="text-xl font-bold hover:underline hover:cursor-pointer w-fit">Steps</summary>

      **Step 1: Export Brave passwords.**
      - Open _Brave_ > _Settings_ > _Autofill & Passwords_, at the _Saved Passwords_ section click <kbd class="kbd text-base-content">‚´∂</kbd> then click `Export Passwords`

      **Step 2: Import passwords file to Firefox.**
      - Open _Firefox_ > <kbd class="kbd text-base-content">‚ò∞</kbd> _Menu_  > _Passwords_ > <kbd class='kbd'>‚ãØ</kbd> _Options_ > _Import from a File..._ > Select exported `Passwords.csv`

     > Remember to delete the `Passwords.csv` file.

</details>
### Bookmarks Migrate
Almost the same steps as exporting/importing passwords.

<details>
   <summary class="text-xl font-bold hover:underline hover:cursor-pointer w-fit">Steps</summary>

      **Step 1: Export Brave bookmarks.**
      - Open _Brave_ > <kbd class="kbd text-base-content">Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd text-base-content">Shift</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd text-base-content">O</kbd> > <kbd class='kbd'>‚ãØ</kbd> _Options_ > _Export Bookmarks_

      **Step 2: Import bookmarks file in Firefox.**
      - Open _Firefox_ > <kbd class="kbd text-base-content">Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd text-base-content">Shift</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd text-base-content">O</kbd> > <kbd class='kbd'>‚ãØ</kbd> _Options_ > _Import and Backup_ > _Import Bookmarks from HTML..._ > Select exported `Bookmarks.html`

</details>

## Firefox "Nice To Have" Features

### Built-in Picture-in-Picture

This is a standout feature of Firefox. If you want to use this on any Chromium browser, you'll need to install an extension with limited functionality.
While you can only play/pause with Chromium Picture-in-Picture, with Firefox, you can backward/forward, change the volume, use the subtitles.

### Built-in Screenshot

I recently discovered that Chrome also has a [built-in screenshot feature](https://zapier.com/blog/full-page-screenshots-in-chrome/), but its usage is complicated. How about Firefox? Let's take a look:

-  Right-click on the toolbar, click _Customize Toolbar_, you can then drag the _Screenshot_ button to the toolbar to start using it.
   ![Toolbar](../assets/browserswitch/ToolbarMag.webp)

Go to a website, click on the _Screenshot_ button. Now you can:

-  Screenshot full page (even it's longggg)
-  Screenshot current visible area
-  Drag & drop to capture only selected area.
-  Click on a component to capture only the component.

## Firefox Issues

**Firefox is currently having some issues:**

-  Worse performance
-  No View Transitions API
-  Lack of extensions (add-ons)

### Performance

These are some of the results I got when I ran tests on Firefox (_116_), Firefox Nightly (_118a1_), Brave Beta (_v1.58.106, Chromium 116_), Microsoft Edge (_116.0.1938.62_) on my computer:

<HorizontalBarChart
   chartTitle="BaseMark Score"
   dataArr={[805, 984, 1213, 1382]}
   arrName={['Firefox', 'Firefox Nightly', 'Brave Beta', 'Microsoft Edge']}
   chartNote="The higher, the better."
   client:load
/>
<br />
<HorizontalBarChart
   chartTitle="Speedometer Score"
   dataArr={[196, 221, 372, 387]}
   arrName={['Firefox', 'Firefox Nightly', 'Brave Beta', 'Microsoft Edge']}
   chartNote="The higher, the better."
   client:load
/>
<br />

<HorizontalBarChart
   chartTitle="JetStream2 Score"
   dataArr={[136, 153, 223, 222]}
   arrName={['Firefox', 'Firefox Nightly', 'Brave Beta', 'Microsoft Edge']}
   chartNote="The higher, the better."
   client:load
/>

‚û°Ô∏è Clearly, Firefox Nightly 118 has some improvements to Firefox 116 in terms of performance, but it can't still beat Brave and Edge when their scores are much higher.

### View Transitions API

This newly available technology allows browsers to create a nice animation/transition effect when the user navigates between pages.\
üëâ Check out the [Browser compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API#browser_compatibility).

Now, let's take a look at a transition on my website:

### Extensions

There are many extensions available for Chromium browsers, but because Firefox has a different core, developers have to create a separate extension (add-on) for Firefox.\
And, as you may have known, Chrome in particular and Chromium browsers in general, have the most users (>65% of web browser usage, another 15% is Safari), which means a larger community for extension developers.

## Conclusion

Nowadays, modern computers are built with decent CPU & GPU, RAM which can handle a lot of tabs. Therefore, the performance doesn't seem to be a problem.
Choice is on ya. I'll stay with Firefox because it has features I need, and Brave BAT makes no sense in my country. If your usage is mainly on phone, I'd recommend Edge/Brave.
